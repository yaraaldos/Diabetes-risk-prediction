        "This project introduces the problem of understanding and predicting diabetes risk using real patient data. The main objective is to solve the challenge of determining whether an individual is diabetic, non-diabetic, or potentially at risk by analyzing features such as age, gender, BMI, creatinine level, and other medical symptoms included in the dataset. This problem is important because early identification of diabetes risk enables timely medical intervention, reduces the chance of complications, and improves overall patient health outcomes. In addition to classification, the project also aims to explore hidden patterns through clustering and generate predictions that support more informed and effective early detection strategies.\n",

This supports direct decision-making and early identification of potential diabetes cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Clustering:**\n",
        "   Group patients with similar health profiles to discover hidden patterns within the dataset. This helps reveal natural groupings or risk patterns that may not be visible through basic analysis, providing deeper insight into patient characteristics.\n",

        "The dataset begins with two identifying fields, **ID** and **No_Pation**, which uniquely differentiate patients but do not carry medical or predictive meaning. Demographic variables include **Gender** and **AGE**, offering essential context because diabetes prevalence and risk often vary across gender and age groups. Physical health is represented through **BMI**, a major risk factor noted in clinical literature due to its strong relationship with obesity and metabolic disorders.\n",

        "During the exploration of the raw dataset in Phase 2, several characteristics became noticeable. Some attributes showed repeated values or patterns that suggested that certain medical measurements may be common across multiple patients. Several numerical columns displayed wide variation in their scales, reflecting the natural differences in units and medical ranges (for example, HbA1c vs. triglycerides). Additionally, some attributes appeared to behave more like identifiers than useful predictors, while categorical fields required standardization for proper model handling. These observations highlighted that the dataset, although rich and structured, would benefit from cleaning and preparation before applying data mining algorithms.\n",
