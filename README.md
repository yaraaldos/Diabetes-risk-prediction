# Early Stage Diabetes Risk Prediction

Lab: 56544  , group number : 2

## Project Description
The problem this project addresses is the **early detection of diabetes** to prevent serious health complications.  
The project focuses on analyzing patient data to predict the risk of early-stage diabetes.

**Our project aims to address this problem by:**
- Classify individuals as **"likely to have early-stage diabetes"** or **"unlikely to have diabetes."**  
- Identify key health indicators linked to diabetes risk.  
- Support early detection and timely medical intervention.

## Project Motivation
Diabetes is a growing global health issue that often develops silently, making early detection crucial. We are motivated to explore this dataset both to understand diabetes risk factors and to develop our data mining skills.

Working on this dataset is important for several reasons:

- It allows the application of machine learning to predict individuals at risk of early-stage diabetes.  
- Early prediction can help guide lifestyle and medical interventions to reduce long-term health problems.  
- The project contributes to raising awareness of diabetes risk and demonstrates the practical impact of data science in healthcare.
